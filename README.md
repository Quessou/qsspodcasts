# qsspodcasts
Lame CLI podcast player in Rust for Linux

# How to use it
Just call `qsspodcasts` in your shell. Or `qsspodcasts --help`
This will open the tui interface, where you can enter commands to register RSS feeds, list podcasts and play them.

# Missing features
Right now the player misses a few features :
* Some searching feature
* Volume management
* Integration with GNOME/KDE

# Ask for improvements
This project does not aim to be finished right now, do not hesitate to post issues on Github !

# Development dependencies (*on ubuntu 20.04 at least*)
* libasound2-dev
* libssl-dev
* libgstreamer1.0-dev
* libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev
